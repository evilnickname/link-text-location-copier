# Link Text and Location Copier
Firefox web extension that helps you creating links right from the context menu. It copies a linkâ€™s text and location, the page title and URL, or selected text and page url as either plain text, html, Markdown or BB Code links.

[Install **Link Text and Location Copier** from addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/link-text-and-location-copier/)

Heavily inspired by the [CoLT](https://github.com/jgbishop/colt) add-on, using code from Firefox's [context-menu-copy-link-with-types](https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples/tree/master/context-menu-copy-link-with-types)  web extension example.
